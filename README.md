Abstract: In real applications, what can be obtained is generally a small data set. At present, most of the practical applications of machine learning use classic models based on big data to solve the problem of small data sets. However, the deep neural network model has complex structure, huge model parameters, and training requires more advanced equipment, which brings certain difficulties to the application. Therefore, Union-net, a lightweight deep network model with a shallow network structure and suitable for small data sets, is proposed.
Experiments on the model with the public data sets cifar10 and 17flowers show that the proposed Unionnet model can perform well on the classification of large data sets and small data sets, and has high practical value in daily application scenarios.
